# **ApplicationHelper module**
The ApplicationHelper module is a utility module that provides a set of helper methods that can be used in views and controllers throughout a Ruby on Rails application.

Here is a description of the title method you provided:

Description: This method sets the title of the page by setting the value of the :title content variable.

Input parameters:

text: A string containing the title text to set.
Output values: None.

Error conditions: None.

Examples of usage:

Here's an example of how you might use the title method in a view:


    <% title 'My Page' %>
This would set the :title content variable to 'My Page', which could then be used to set the title of the page in the layout file. For example:


    <title><%= content_for :title %></title>
This would insert the value of the **:title** content variable into the <title> element of the page.


# **subdomain function**
Description: This function generates a URL for a given subdomain by concatenating the subdomain with the host of the application.

Input parameters:

subdomain (string): The subdomain to be used in the generated URL. This parameter is optional, and if it is not provided, the function will use an empty string as the subdomain.
Output values:

A string containing the generated URL.
Error conditions:

None.
Examples of usage:


    with_subdomain("test") # returns "test.localhost" (assuming the host of the application is "localhost")
    with_subdomain(nil) # returns "localhost"
    with_subdomain("") # returns "localhost"

**url_for function**:

Description: This function generates a URL based on the provided options. If the :subdomain option is present, it will be used to generate the URL using the with_subdomain function.

Input parameters:

options (hash): A hash of options to be used to generate the URL. This parameter is optional, and if it is not provided, the function will use the default options.
Output values:

A string containing the generated URL.
