The ApplicationHelper module is a utility module that provides a set of helper methods that can be used in views and controllers throughout a Ruby on Rails application.

Here is a description of the title method you provided:

Description: This method sets the title of the page by setting the value of the :title content variable.

Input parameters:

text: A string containing the title text to set.
Output values: None.

Error conditions: None.

Examples of usage:

Here's an example of how you might use the title method in a view:


    <% title 'My Page' %>
This would set the :title content variable to 'My Page', which could then be used to set the title of the page in the layout file. For example:


    <title><%= content_for :title %></title>
This would insert the value of the :title content variable into the <title> element of the page.
